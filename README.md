# Notes_for_technologies
This repo contains notes and resources for learning about different concepts and technologies.

This is created for others who wish to learn about software and are unsure of where to start.

If thats you then id say just start somewhere and keep learning. 

Learning software takes time and is only done through consistency.

"Being proficient with software only comes after you spent 20 years in the trenches,
if your wondering why it does not make sense yet, its because you havent been in the trenches long enough."
